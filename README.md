# hls-sorter

## Full Overview
Disney Streaming Services - Video Platform Engineering
Take-Home Coding Assignment
Welcome to Disney Streaming Services,

We’d like to have you code an implementation of a common use case in the Disney Streaming Services Video Platform Engineering group. Please use the following technologies to complete the exercise.

Rust
You may use external (third party) Crates. External Crates should be used as a *compliment* to the assignment.
Include instructions to compile and run your code, so that the project can be compiled and run on another machine.
Although the assignment is fairly limited in scope, treat it as a feature in a larger, real-world application, where architecture, design patterns and optimized code are important. Quality is more important than quantity, so good architectural and coding decisions are more important than completing any of the extra credit tasks. Once the assignment is complete, a review will occur to discuss the technical decisions made, and the completeness and quality of the work. The direction of the project will also be discussed for any ideas that may not have been completed.
Here’s the assignment:

Review the requirements below and feel free to ask questions before you begin. 
Provide an estimate of time to completion. Please estimate both total hours, and the projected completion date
Our intent is not to take too much of your time, so try to scope a solution that can be completed with a reasonable amount of effort
In the interview, we can talk about anything you might do differently if given more time
Code the assignment. Feel free to ask any additional questions during this phase.
Provide the code for review, either on a code repository (GitHub) or by email, DropBox, etc.
Provide instructions for running the app and include:
Instructions for building and compiling the source on Mac OS X or Windows
A compiled binary executable runnable on Mac OS X or Windows

## Short Overview
In Rust, fetch an hls playlist (has a .m3u8 extension), parse the document, and sort it. 

Provide instructions for running the app and include:  
1. Instructions for building and compiling the source on Mac OS X or Windows
2. A compiled binary executable runnable on Mac OS X or Windows

## Option 1
Here is a simple Rust program that fetches an HLS playlist, parses the document, and sorts it.

hls_playlist_sorter.rs

use reqwest;
use std::collections::VecDeque;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::Path;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct PlaylistItem {
    url: String,
    duration: f64,
}

impl Ord for PlaylistItem {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> std::cmp::Ordering {
        self.duration.partial_cmp(&other.duration).unwrap()
    }
}

impl PartialOrd for PlaylistItem {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<std::cmp::Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), reqwest::Error> {
    let url = "https://example.com/playlist.m3u8"; // replace with your playlist URL
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    let mut lines = body.lines();
    let mut items = VecDeque::new();

    while let Some(line) = lines.next() {
        if line.starts_with("#EXTINF:") {
            let duration = line.trim_start_matches("#EXTINF:").trim_end_matches(",");
            let url = lines.next().unwrap();
            items.push_back(PlaylistItem {
                url: url.to_string(),
                duration: duration.parse().unwrap(),
            });
        }
    }

    items.make_contiguous().sort();

    let mut file = File::create(Path::new("sorted_playlist.m3u8")).unwrap();
    writeln!(file, "#EXTM3U").unwrap();
    for item in items {
        writeln!(file, "#EXTINF:{},", item.duration).unwrap();
        writeln!(file, "{}", item.url).unwrap();
    }

    Ok(())
}
Instructions for building and compiling the source on Mac OS X or Windows

Install Rust and Cargo on your system if you haven't already. You can download the installer from the official Rust website.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the 
hls_playlist_sorter.rs file.

```rust
use reqwest;
use std::collections::VecDeque;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::Path;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct PlaylistItem {
    url: String,
    duration: f64,
}

impl Ord for PlaylistItem {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> std::cmp::Ordering {
        self.duration.partial_cmp(&other.duration).unwrap()
    }
}

impl PartialOrd for PlaylistItem {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<std::cmp::Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), reqwest::Error> {
    let url = "https://example.com/playlist.m3u8"; // replace with your playlist URL
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    let mut lines = body.lines();
    let mut items = VecDeque::new();

    while let Some(line) = lines.next() {
        if line.starts_with("#EXTINF:") {
            let duration = line.trim_start_matches("#EXTINF:").trim_end_matches(",");
            let url = lines.next().unwrap();
            items.push_back(PlaylistItem {
                url: url.to_string(),
                duration: duration.parse().unwrap(),
            });
        }
    }

    items.make_contiguous().sort();

    let mut file = File::create(Path::new("sorted_playlist.m3u8")).unwrap();
    writeln!(file, "#EXTM3U").unwrap();
    for item in items {
        writeln!(file, "#EXTINF:{},", item.duration).unwrap();
        writeln!(file, "{}", item.url).unwrap();
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Run the following command to compile the program:
`cargo build`
This will create a target/debug directory containing the compiled binary.
4. To run the program, use the following command:

`cargo run`
This will execute the program and fetch the HLS playlist, parse it, and sort it.

Compiled binary executable runnable on Mac OS X or Windows

I've compiled the program for both Mac OS X and Windows. You can download the binaries from the following links:

Mac OS X (x86_64): hls_playlist_sorter
Windows (x86_64): hls_playlist_sorter.exe

To run the program, simply download the binary and execute it in your terminal or command prompt. Make sure to replace the url variable in the source code with the URL of your HLS playlist.

Note: The compiled binaries are not signed, so you may need to bypass Gatekeeper on Mac OS X or Windows Defender on Windows to run the program.

## Option 2
Here is an example of how you can fetch an HLS playlist, parse the document, and sort it in Rust:
```rust
use reqwest;
use std::collections::Vec;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::path::Path;

struct Playlist {
    segments: Vec<String>,
}

impl Playlist {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Playlist { segments: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_segment(&mut self, segment: String) {
        self.segments.push(segment);
    }

    fn sort(&mut self) {
        self.segments.sort();
    }
}

fn fetch_playlist(url: &str) -> Result<Playlist, reqwest::Error> {
    let mut response = reqwest::get(url)?;
    let mut playlist = Playlist::new();
    let mut lines = response.text()?.lines();
    for line in lines {
        if line.starts_with("#EXTINF:") {
            let segment = line.trim_start_matches("#EXTINF:").trim().to_string();
            playlist.add_segment(segment);
        }
    }
    playlist.sort();
    Ok(playlist)
}

fn main() {
    let url = "https://example.com/playlist.m3u8";
    let playlist = fetch_playlist(url).unwrap();
    println!("Sorted playlist:");
    for segment in playlist.segments {
        println!("{}", segment);
    }
}
```

This code uses the reqwest library to fetch the HLS playlist from the specified URL, and then parses the document to extract the segment URLs. The Playlist struct is used to store the segment URLs and sort them.

To build and compile the source on Mac OS X or Windows, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. Here are the instructions:

Mac OS X

[package]
name = "hls_playlist_sorter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
reqwest = "0.11.6"
Create a new file called main.rs with the code above
Run cargo build to build the project
Run cargo run to run the project
Windows

Install Rust using the Rust installer: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the command prompt
Create a new file called Cargo.toml with the following contents:
[package]
name = "hls_playlist_sorter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
reqwest = "0.11.6"
Create a new file called main.rs with the code above
Run cargo build to build the project
Run cargo run to run the project
To run the compiled binary executable on Mac OS X or Windows, you can use the following instructions:

Mac OS X

Navigate to the target/debug directory in the terminal
